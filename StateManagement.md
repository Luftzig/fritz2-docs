# State Management

Building your `Store`, you can add `Handler`s to respond to actions and adjust your model accordingly:

```kotlin
val store = object : RootStore<String>("") {
    val append = handle<String> { model, action -> //action is a String
        "$model$action"
    }

    val clear = handle { model ->
        ""
    }
}
```
Whenever a `String` is sent to the `append` `Handler` it updates the model by appending the text to it's actual model. `clear` is a `Handler` that does not need any information to do it's work, so you can just leave out the second parameter.

Since everything in fritz2 is reactive, you won't call the handler directly most of the time but connect a `Flow` of actions to it:

```kotlin
val stringsToAppend: Flow<String> = ... //we will see, where you get this stream from later on.
store.append <= stringsToAppend
```

Each `Store` inherits a `Handler` called `update` accepting the same type as the `Store` as it's action. It just updates the `Store`'s value to the new value it receives. You can use this handler to conveniently implement _two-way-databinding_ by using the `changes` event-flow of an `input`-`Tag` for example:

```kotlin
val store = RootStore<String>("")

val myComponent = html {
    input {
        value = store.data
        store.update <= changes.values()
    }
}
```

`changes` in this example is a flow of events created by listening to the `Change`-Event of the underlying input-element. Calling `values()` on it, extracts the current value from the input.
Whenever such an event is raised, a new value appears on the `Flow` and is processed by the `update`-Handler of the `Store` to update the model. Event-flows are available for [all HTML5-events](https://api.fritz2.dev/fritz2/io.fritz2.dom/-with-events/).
There are some more [convenience functions](https://api.fritz2.dev/fritz2/io.fritz2.dom/) to help you to extract the data you need from an event or control event-processing.

Of course you can map the elements of the `Flow` to a specific action-type before you connect it to the `Handler`. This way you can also add information from the rendering-context to the action.

You can also use any other source for a `Flow` like recurring timer events or even external events like web-sockets, local storage, etc.

Next we will have a look at how to use [Lists as a model](ListsinaModel.html).
