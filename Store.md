#Store

In fritz2 you will use one or more Stores to handle you app's state. It heavily depends on Kotlin's Flow. If you are not familiar with this concept, please read a little about Flows first.

Let's assume, the state of your app is a simple String. Creating a Store to manage that state is quite easy:

val s = RootStore<String>("initial value")
Every Store offers a Flow name data, that you can be bound to an element in your html:

html {
    p {
        text("actual state = ")
        s.bind()   
    }
}
By calling s.bind() you create a MountPoint as the end of your data-flow. That means that a DOM-element is created by the mount point (in our case a simple TextNode) and bound to your data so that it will change whenever that state in your Store is updated. This is what is called precise data binding.

Of course you can call every intermediate action on the data-flow as on every other Flow, like map,filter, etc.:

html {
    p {
        text("you have entered ")
        s.map { it.length }.bind()
        text(" characters so far.")
}
Knowing this, you can easily assume, how you can derive a reactive component from your state:

val uppercase = data.map {
    html {
        p {
            it.toUpperCase().bind()
        }
    } 
}

html {
    div {
        uppercase.bind()
    }
}.mount("target")
Doing so is called one-way-databinding. You can also bind a Flow to an attribute:

div {
    class = store.data.map(...)
}
In this case just the attribute value will change when the model in your store changes. fritz2 offers pre-defined properties for every HTML5-attribute.

But how can you change the model-data in a store? Let's have a look at State Management.
