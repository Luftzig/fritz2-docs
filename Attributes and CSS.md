# Attributes and CSS

To create rich HTML-interfaces you have to use many different attributes. In fritz2 there are some different ways to fit every use-case.

On each `Tag` you can set static values for `class` and `id` by just using the optional parameters of it's factory function:
```kotlin
html {
    div("some-static-css-class") {
        button(id = "someId")
    }
}
```

All the other attributes you can set inside the `Tag`'s content by just just assign it a `Flow` of the according type. The attribute's value will be updated in the DOM whenever a new value appears on the `Flow`. If the value is constant, just wrap it with the `const()`-function:
```kotlin
val flowOfInts = ... //i.e. get it from some Store

html {
    input {
        placeholder = const("some text")
        maxLength = flowOfInts
    }
}
```

If you want to set a static value for a custom (data-) attribute, use the `attr()`-function:
```kotlin
html {
    div {
        attr("data-something", "someValue")
    }
}
```

Of course you can also bind dynamic values (from a `Flow`) to a custom attribute:
```kotlin
val someFlowOfStrings = ... 

html {
    div {
        someFlowOfStrings.bindAttr("data-something)
    }
}
```

A very special attribute is the `class` of a `Tag`. As seen above, you can set a static base-class just by the parameter of the factory-function of the `Tag`.

You can add dynamic classes by assign a `Flow` of Strings to the `classMap`-attribute as with any other attribute. The same works for `List<String>`s with the `classList`-attribute.

In addition to this, you can build a map from you model data, that enables and disables single classes dynamically:
```kotlin
html {
    div {
        classMap = toDoStore.data.map { mapOf(
            "completed" to it.completed, // a boolean-attribute in the data-model
            "editing" to it.editing
        )}
    }
}
```
