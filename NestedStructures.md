#Nested Structures

Most of the time your model for a view will not be of a simple data-type or a `List`, but a complex entity, like a person, having a name, multiple addresses, email, birth-date,...

In this case you will most probably need a `Store` for the single properties of your main entity, and - later on - for the properties of the sub-entity like the street in an address in our example from above.

fritz2 uses a mechanism called `Lens` to describe the relationship between an entity and it`s sub-entities and properties. So before you continue, please make yourself familiar with [[Lenses]] in fritz2.

Having a `Lens` available, that points to some specific property, it is very easy to get a `SubStore` for exactly that property from a `Store` of the parent entity:

```kotlin
    val outerStore = RootStore(Outer(Inner("hello"), "world"))
    // remember, the Lenses-object is created by fritz2-optics per package
    val innerStore = outerStore.sub(Lenses.Outer.inner)
```

Now you can use your `innerStore` exactly like any other `Store` to set up _two-way-databinding_, call `sub(...)` again to access the properties of `Inner`. If a `SubStore` contains a `List`-type, you can of course iterate over it by using `each()` or `eachStore()` like you are used to. It is just fully recursive from here on down to the deepest nested parts of your entity.

You can even add `Handler`s to your `SubStore` by simply calling the `handle`-method:

```kotlin
val booleanSubStore = mainStore.sub(someLens)
val switch = booleanSubStore.handle { model: Boolean ->
   !model
}

html {
    ...
        button {
            text("switch state")
            switch <= clicks
        }
    ...
}

````

To keep your code well structured it is recommended to implement complex logic at your `RootStore`(or inherit it by using interfaces). But for small (convenience-) actions like the above it is a proper solution.

Now that you can handle all kinds of data and structures in your `Store`s you might want to check, if they are valid. In fritz2 this is done by [[Validation]].
