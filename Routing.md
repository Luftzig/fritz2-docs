#Routing

Writing a Single Page Application (SPA), you might need a way to render a certain view depending on url-parameters. This is called routing. 
fritz2 the hash-part of the url which starts with a `#`: `https://my.doma.in/path#hash`. 
Url-parameters (`?`) are (usually) handled by the server and url-hashes (`#`) instead are handled by the browser.

Fritz2 offers a general mechanism for using client-site routing in your SPA. Therefore it includes a class called `Router` wich registers itself to listen for the specific dom-events when the hash changes. In addition a `Router` needs a `Route` which is an interface you have to implement to use it:
```kotlin
interface Route<T> {
    val default: T
    fun unmarshal(hash: String): T
    fun marshal(route: T): String
}
```
A `Route` always has a default route to start with. It also needs a way to unmarshal and marshal the url-hash string to a kotlin (data-)class and vice versa.

To make it easier to use this mechanism we have already implemented two ways of handling routing for you. You can actual choose between:
* `StringRoute` uses the url-hash how it is.
* `MapRoute` marshals and unmarshals the url-hash to `Map<String,String>` where `&` is the separator between the entries.

If none of those fits your needs, you are free to implement your own `Route` on your own data type instead.

The usage of routing is straightforward:

Using simple `String`s by `StringRoute`:
```kotlin
val router = router("welcome")

html {
  section {
    router.routes.map { site ->
      when(site) {
          "welcome" -> div { +"Welcome" }
          "pageA" -> div { +"Page A" }
          "pageB" -> div { +"Page B" }
          else -> div { +"not found" }
      }
    }.bind()
  }
}       
```

Use a `Map` of parameters by `MapRoute`:
```kotlin
val router = router(mapOf("page", "welcome"))

html {
  section {
    router.select("page") {
      val (name, rest) = it
      when(name) {
          "welcome" -> div { +"Welcome" }
          "pageA" -> div { +"Page A" }
          "pageB" -> div { +"Page B" }
          else -> div { +"not found" }
      }
    }.bind()
  }
}       
```
A router wich uses a `MapRoute` offers an extra `select` method which extract the values for the given key (here `"page"`) and needs a function to map the value. Therefore it returns a `Pair` of the actual value and the complete `Map` to enable you to decide what to render.

If you want to use your own special `Route` instead, you can do so by
```kotlin
class SetRoute(override val default: Set<String>) : Route<Set<String>> {
  override fun unmarshal(hash: String): Set<String> {
      TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }

  override fun marshal(route: Set<String>): String {
      TODO("Not yet implemented")
  }
}

val router = router(SetRoute(setOf("welcome")))

html {
  section {
    router.routes.map { set ->
      TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }.bind()
  }
}  
```
So you have all possibilities in fritz2 to get your routing done.

If you want to change your current route (i.e. when an event is fired) you can do this by calling `navTo`: 
```
button {
    text("Navigate to Page A")
    router.navTo <= clicks.map { mapOf("page" to "pageA") }
}
```
Also you can set the url-hash on an initial page request, so this route is used.
For example: `https://mysite.com/myapp#page=welcome`
